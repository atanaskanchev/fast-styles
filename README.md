# âš¡ Fast Styles
A lightweight and efficient React Native styling package that generates styles during compile time without any runtime overhead.

- Support for single, multiple, and compound variants
- Runtime or compile-time style generation using a babel plugin
- Typescript support with variant autocompletion as a property
- Drop-in replacement for StyleSheet

### The problem
There are many alternatives that allow you to build your components using JSX and props. We're not going to argue that it's easy to create components in this way because it certainly is. However, exposing those props comes with a cost.

What should be a solution for styling ends up becoming a performance problem. Each component you use from these libraries ends up generating dozens of operations, merging objects at runtime, and significantly impacting rendering time. Checking this problem is as easy as choosing your favorite library, selecting a handful of components, and measuring their rendering time.

### The solution
Fortunately, there is a solution to easily handle variants and themes in React Native, and that is to generate styles at compile-time. Using the styled HOC from this library, you can generate styles for different variants of your components without adding any runtime overhead. In fact, the resulting code can be more efficient than using statically created styles with `StyleeSheet.create()`.

### Usage
This example creates a ButtonRoot component from a touchable and defines the `type` variant to change the button color.
```javascript
const ButtonRoot = styled(TouchableOpacity, {
  // base styles
  display: "flex",
  alignItems: "center",
  justifyContent: "center",
  height: 40,
  width: "100%",
  maxWidth: 200,
  borderRadius: 20,
  // variants
  variants: {
    type: {
      "primary": {
        positive: "green",
      },
      "negative": {
        backgroundColor: "red",
      },
      "disabled": {
        backgroundColor: "gray",
      },
    },
  },
});

const Button = (props) => {
  return (
    <ButtonRoot variant={'positive'} onPress={props.onPress}
    >
      {props.children}
    </ButtonRoot>
  );
};

```

### Compund Variants
When needing to set styles for a variant based on a combination of other variants, you can create a rule for compound variants using the + sign. 
```javascript
const ButtonRoot = styled(TouchableOpacity, {
  display: "flex",
  alignItems: "center",
  justifyContent: "center",
  variants: {
    variant: {
      solid: {},
      outline: {
        backgroundColor: "transparent",
        borderWidth: 3,
      },
      "solid+positive": {
        backgroundColor: "green",
      },
      "solid+negative": {
        backgroundColor: "red",
      },
      "solid+disabled": {
        backgroundColor: "gray",
      },
      "outline+positive": {
        borderColor: "green",
      },
      "outline+negative": {
        borderColor: "red",
      },
      "outline+disabled": {
        borderColor: "gray",
      },
    },
    type: {
      positive: {},
      negative: {},
      disabled: {},
    },
  },
});
```

### Under the hood 

The `styled` HOC generates a map with all possible combinations for each variant. 

```javascript
const Button = styled(TouchableOpacity, {
  variants: {
    type: {
      primary: { /* small styles */ },
      secondary: { /* small styles */ }
    },
    size: {
      small: { /* small styles */ },
      medium: { /* medium styles */ },
      large: { /* large styles */ },
    },
  },
});
```
For example, if a button component has a variant called `type` that offers options like `primary` and `secondary`, and it has another variant called `size` that offers options like `small`, `medium`, and `large`, applying the styled HOC will generate a map like this:
```javascript
const buttonStyles = {
  "primary+small": { /* combined styles */ },
  "primary+medium": { /* combined styles */ },
  "primary+large": { /* combined styles */ },
  "secondary+small": { /* combined styles */ },
  "secondary+medium": { /* combined styles */ },
  "secondary+large": { /* combined styles */ },
};
```

Additionally, it will detect the variants, create a function to extract dependencies, and memoize the application of styles based on changes in the properties of each variant.

```javascript
// efficient, compile-time generated 
const getDependencies = (props) => [props.type, props.size];

// the result will look very similar to this component
const Button = (props) => {
  const dependencies = getDependencies(props);
  const styles = useMemo(() => {
    const currentStyle = dependencies.join("+");
    return buttonStyles[currentStyle];
  }, [dependencies]);
};
```
